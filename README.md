## Description
Any GitHub project needs a good README.md file that explains the purpose of the application as well as how to install it, run it, contribute to it, and to contact the author(s) for guidance and clarification. This project's goal is to provide a tool built on [node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/about/) that will assist in this process. 

The _"README.md Generator"_ app facilitates this process by using the Console to present a series of prompts where the end user is free to select most of the sections of their README.md file. The user is <span style="text-decoration: underline">*required*</span> to enter the "Project Title", "Description", "GitHub username", and their "Email Address"; but, all other recomended sections are presented as optional and the end user can decide if he/she wants to include it or not. Recomended sections are presented with a selection option that defaults to "true", and optional sections are presented with a selection option that defaults to "false".

This project uses [node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/about/) as the framework and glue of the application and integrates it with several npm packages like [inquirer.js](https://www.npmjs.com/package/inquirer) - to present the user with prompts to fill-out the content of the README.md file, [badge-maker](https://www.npmjs.com/package/badge-maker) - to design and create the application licensing badge, and [node-fetch](https://www.npmjs.com/package/node-fetch) - to implement the FETCH API in [node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/about/).
